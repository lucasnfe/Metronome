Procedurally generated rogue-like jump and shoot game.

1. Introduction

Mega Man X was a huge success when it came out in the 90s. This project aims
to improve the replayability of this game using procedural content generation (PCG).
The structure will be similar: intro level (teachs core mechanics and motivation),
map with several bosses and final Level.

2. Narrative

X is a good vampire which is a slave working for a terrific boss. Once X makes
three attempts to help the society in his job, his boss curses him and jails
him in a second dimension world (souls world). X finds himself very weak,
in this dark world and with an extreme reavenge feeling. He must figure out how
to scape from this world in order to kill his boss and free the slaves.
This world is guarded by 12 evil souls that you have to beat in order to free
yourself.

This world has an ancient vampire which never managed to scape but which have
built items to help you.

3. Mechanics

Jump and Shoot, growing stronger. Destroy all the 'generators' is the only way to
scape from the dark world. It never stops creating content for you, so you
keep in a loop if you don't destroy it. Each generator controls one part of
the generation algorithm, when you kill a generator, the world stops changing.
